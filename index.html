    <p><b>Football</b> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America, Ireland and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football" target="_blank"><abbr title="Gaelic_football">Gaelic Football</abbr></a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-1" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> These various forms of football share to varying extents common origins and are known as "<b>football codes</b>".</p>
    
     <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-2" target="_blank">[2]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-3" target="_blank">[3]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-fifa-or-4" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup> Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.<sup>[5][6]</sup> The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.<sup>[7]</sup> By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.<sup>[8]</sup> In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.<sup>[9]</sup></p>

    <h3 id="common_elements">Common elements</h3>
    <p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.<sup>[10]</sup></p>
    <p>Common rules among the sports include:<sup>[11]</sup></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
        </li>
        <li>A clearly defined area in which to play the game.</li>
        <li>Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.</li>
        <li>Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.</li>
        <li>Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e. no additional equipment such as bats or sticks.</li>
   </ul>
    <p>In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.<sup>[10]</sup> In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts. </p>

    <h3 id="etymology">Etymology</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". It is widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[12] There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot.[13] There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.</p>

    <h4 id="ancient_games">Ancient Games</h4>
    <p>The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern association football.[14] It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC, attested by descriptions in a military manual.[15][16] The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.[17] This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari, several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie). </p>

    <h4 id="naive_american">Naive Americans</h4>
    <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit in Greenland.[29] There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman.[citation needed] Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-day association football played amongst Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century.<br><br>

    Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of "football".[citation needed] </p>

    <p>Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked. 
        <br><br>
        A game known as "football" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a "football" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word "pass" in the most recent translation is derived from "huc percute" (strike it here) and later "repercute pilam" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as "goal" is "metum", literally meaning the "pillar at each end of the circus course" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to "get hold of the ball before [another player] does" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation "Throw yourself against him" (Age, objice te illi).

   <p>Other firsts in the medieval and early modern eras:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> "A football", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486.[42] This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners' Book of St Albans. It states: "a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal".</li>
        <li>A pair of football boots were ordered by King Henry VIII of England in 1526</li>
        <li>Women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir Philip Sidney in one of his poems: "[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, when she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes".</li>
        <li>The first references to goals are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to "goals" in Cornish hurling. Carew described how goals were made: "they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales". He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.</li>
        <li>The first direct reference to scoring a goal is in John Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659): "I'll play a gole at camp-ball" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to "when the Ball to throw, and drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe".</li>

<h3 id="use_of_the_word">Use of the word "football"</h3><hr>
<i>Further information: Football (word)</i>
<p>The word football, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world. Most often, the word "football" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region (which is association football in most countries). So, effectively, what the word "football" means usually depends on where one says it.<br><br>
    In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as "football", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, "football" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word "football" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer.</p>
<p>
    Of the 45 national FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use Football in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in Canada and the United States use Soccer in their names. A few FIFA affiliates have recently "normalised" to using "Football", including:
<ul>
    <li>Australia's association football governing body changed its name in 2005 from using "soccer" to "football".</li>
    <li>New Zealand's governing body renamed itself in 2007, saying "the international game is called football".</li>
    <li>Samoa changed from "Samoa Football (Soccer) Federation" to "Football Federation Samoa" in 2009.</li>
</ul>
